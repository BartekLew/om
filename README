liberation â€“ what if shell was a debugger?

I have an impression that programming became way to messy.
We have software in blob packages which limits using it very
much. What if extracting functionality from software was
easy? This project is trial to take of limits from software
we use, give a way to analyse running code in a way that
you can easly extract stuff you are interested in.

Project is coded in x64 assembly for Linux. I feel most
freedom with assembly, I hate limitations of high level
languages, I love simplicity. C would be almost a good
language, but it's too old, it doesn't let do a lot of stuff
once nobody would think of (because limited resources and
because only high level languages feed imagination). I have
an impression that all languages have this features, because
all of them stick to stuff invented decades ago so they rely
on outdated ideas. Ah, and the speed. I love that assembler
is so fast to compile and run.

Of course coding in raw assembly would be a nightmare. No
sane programmer would do that. That's why I generate code,
which let's me keep assembly flavour with total
predictability. Probably one day it will make yet another
programming language.
